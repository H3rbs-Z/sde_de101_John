First Assignment

I would start by thinking of where my possible data would be coming from, then and I would sort and clean my data by pulling them and allocating them into 
places they need to be. I would also use graphs and tools that are necessary for Data analytics. Also, I would also try to implement the use of machine learning
to parse and make the data more desirable. (without bias of course)
